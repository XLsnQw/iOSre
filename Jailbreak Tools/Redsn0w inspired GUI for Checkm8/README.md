# Redsn0w-inspired
Redsn0w Inspired is a Gui for checkm8 that gives you a bit of a nastalgic feeling. Put MacOS in light mode.

# What it can do
 1. Standard Demote, dump securerom and enter Pwndfu mode.
 2. Verbose boot on iPhone X. iOS 12.2, 13.1.1, and 13.1.2
 3. Alloc8 and uninstall alloc8
 4. Exit recovery mode (Needed it for personal use)
 5. Downgrade to iOS 10.3.3 on iPhone 5s. (Beta - Untested as of now - Read the homebrew section.)
 
# Important
In order for Redsn0w Inspired to work properly, please put it in applications. (I cd into "applications" to get into iPwndfu's folder)

I plan to add more eventually but don't have much time with school in the way. Updates will hopefully come every weekend. Whether their small or an important one.

I will make it open source soon however, i'm using this as a learning experience. If you have a suggestion or found a bug, please contact me via Twitter. @LamotheColby

# Homebrew
You need homebrew for downgrading to work. Simply type this in terminal to install, type in password when asked.

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

# Downgrade
You also need a iOS 10.3.3 ipsw. You can download one from ipsw.me
Put it on your desktop!
